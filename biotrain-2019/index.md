# 2019 HudsonAlpha BioTrain Computational Biology Bootcamp
**Logistics**: The Bootcamp is Monday, June 3, 2019 in the McCrary Teaching Lab on the second floor of the Paul Propst Center (800 Hudson Way) from 8a - 4:30p

*Objective/Rationale:* This one day workshop is intended to provide HudsonAlpha undergraduate student BioTrain interns and graduate rotation students an introduction to computational biology through a discussion on why computers are necessary in genomics, short unix shell and R tutorials followed by hands-on exercises [The Carpentries lessons](https://carpentries.org/), and tips on how to ask for help, keeping a computational lab notebook, and finding additional learning resources. 



### May 30, 2019 & May 31, 2019:
**Lunch**: Computer set-up. James and/or Bryan will be around to help make sure computers are set up for next week.

### June 3, 2019:

**8am-9am**: Computer set-up This can be done anytime before bootcamp begins, but helpers will be available during this hour.
Please ensure you have the following software and data on the computer you intend to use during the workshop:
1. Make sure you have access to a [Bash Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) (use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows); and download the [data-shell.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) file
2. Install a) R, b) RStudio, and c) download the r-novice-inflammation data

**9am-10am**: An Introduction to Biology with Computers 

10am-12pm: Introduction to the unix shell

[Introducing the Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/)

[Navigating Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/)

[Working with Files and Directories](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/)

*Aside:*
1. Accessing the HudsonAlpha Compute Cluster

12pm-12:30pm: Keeping a Computational Lab Notebook & How to Get Programming Help (slides)

12:30pm-1:30pm: Lunch

1:30pm-4:00pm: Programming with R

[Analyzing Biology Data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data/)

[Writing Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R/)

[Analyzing Multiple Data Sets](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/03-loops-R/)

4pm-4:30pm: What Now? (Continued Learning) (slides)




More Practice (and see ‘What Now?’ slides above):


Check these shell lessons out if you:

-want to combine existing shell commands

-perform the same action on many files in the shell

-need to save and reuse shell commands


Check these R lessons out if you:
-want to practice more R programming with the inflammation data set used during bootcamp

-are interested in R programming lessons for reproducible scientific analysis
