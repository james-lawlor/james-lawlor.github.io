# 2019 HudsonAlpha BioTrain Computational Biology Bootcamp
**Logistics**: The Bootcamp is Monday, June 3, 2019 in the McCrary Teaching Lab on the second floor of the Paul Propst Center (800 Hudson Way) from 8a - 4:30p

*Objective/Rationale:* This one day workshop is intended to provide HudsonAlpha undergraduate student BioTrain interns and graduate rotation students an introduction to computational biology through a discussion on why computers are necessary in genomics, short unix shell and R tutorials followed by hands-on exercises [The Carpentries lessons](https://carpentries.org/), and tips on how to ask for help, keeping a computational lab notebook, and finding additional learning resources. 



### May 30, 2019 & May 31, 2019:
**Lunch**: Computer set-up. James and/or Bryan will be around to help make sure computers are set up for next week.

### June 3, 2019:

**8am-9am**: Computer set-up This can be done anytime before bootcamp begins, but helpers will be available during this hour.

[Detailed Windows Setup Instructions](windows.html)

Please ensure you have the following software and data on the computer you intend to use during the workshop:
1. Make sure you have access to a [Bash Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) (use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows); and download the [data-shell.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) file
2. Install a) [R Programming Language](https://cloud.r-project.org/), b) [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), and c) download the [r-novice-inflammation](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/setup.html) data

### More Practice :
See the "What Now?" slides above.

Check these shell lessons out if you:
* want to combine existing shell commands: [Pipes and Filters](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter/index.html)
* perform the same action on many files in the shell: [Loops](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/index.html)
* need to save and reuse shell commands: [Shell Scripts](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script/index.html)


Check these R lessons out if you:
* want to practice more R programming with the inflammation data set used during bootcamp
* are interested in R programming lessons for reproducible scientific analysis

### Windows-Specific Tips & Gotchas
* Copy & Paste:
* On windows, you are used to ctrl+c and ctrl+v to copy and paste. This will not work in Git-Bash window because ctrl+c and ctrl + v have different meanings in Unix
* To copy:
  * Select text in the git-bash window with the mouse, and it will automatically be copied
  * Or, use the left-click menu
  * Use ctrl+insert (some laptops may not have this as a separate key)
* To paste:
  * Click with the middle mouse button
  * Or, use the left-click menu
  * Use shift+insert (some laptops may not have this as a separate key)
