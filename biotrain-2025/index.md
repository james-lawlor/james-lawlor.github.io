**Course Development**
Course content adapted from the Software Carpentries lessons and the 2018 Bootcamp organized by [Brittany Lasseigene, PhD](https://www.lasseigne.org), Assistant Professor at the [University of Alabama in Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/home/)

##  Wednesday, May 29, 2025:

**8:00am - 8:15am**: Computer set-up.

[Detailed Windows Setup Instructions](#detailed-windows-setup-instructions)

[Mac: Changing your shell to bash](#setting-up-bash-shell-on-mac)

### Data Setup
We will download the "shell lesson data" together as a group using the shell so that we can make sure it lands in a consistent location.
We will use the following commands:
```
# Copy from here
cd
curl -k --output shell-lesson-data.zip https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
curl -k --output r-novice-inflammation.zip https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/data/r-novice-inflammation-data.zip
unzip -o shell-lesson-data.zip
mkdir r-novice-inflammation
cd r-novice-inflammation
unzip -o ../r-novice-inflammation.zip
cd ..
rm shell-lesson-data.zip
rm r-novice-inflammation.zip
# To here. Paste into the terminal and hit enter.

```
Copy and paste this block into your terminal application and then hit enter. If you're using Windows, to paste into Git Bash you will right-click on the window and select paste from menu. This will run several commands to download and unzip the course data within a few seconds. 

### Where is the data?
We have put the data in your home directory on your computer. The path will look a bit different for everyone depending on your computer, but it may look like:
Mac: `/Users/jameslawlor`
Windows: `/c/Users/james`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The Carpentries lessons assume that the data is located on your Desktop, i.e. at a path like `/Users/jameslawlor/Desktop/shell-lesson-data` however we have place it elsewhere because there is variation in where different computers store the desktop. This means we will ignore references to the Desktop while working through the lesson.

Instead, the unix shell data is in a subdirectory of your home directory called `shell-lesson-data` (i.e.`/Users/jameslawlor/shell-lesson-data`).
The R data is in a subdirectory of your home directory called `r-novice-inflammation` and inside a subdirectory called (i.e.`/Users/jameslawlor/r-novice-inflammation/data`)

Please ensure you have the following software and data on the computer you intend to use during the workshop:
1. Make sure you have access to a Bash shell: use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows; Terminal is the built-in program for Mac, however we will need to change the shell by running the command `bash`
2. Install:
  * a) [R Programming Language](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * b) [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. Using the bash shell, we will all walk through downloading the lesson data together. See above under "Data Setup"

Check these shell lessons out if you:
* want to combine existing shell commands: [Pipes and Filters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter.html)
* perform the same action on many files in the shell: [Loops](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop.html)
* need to save and reuse shell commands: [Shell Scripts](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script.html)


Check these R lessons out if you:
* [want to practice more R programming with the inflammation data set used during bootcamp](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
* [are interested in R programming lessons for reproducible scientific analysis](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)

### Windows-Specific Tips & Gotchas
* Copy & Paste:
  * On windows, you are used to `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` to copy and paste. This will not work in Git-Bash window because `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` have different meanings in Unix
  * To copy:
    * Select text in the git-bash window with the mouse, and it will automatically be copied
    * Or, use the right-click menu
    * Use `ctrl+insert` (some laptops may not have this as a separate key)
  * To paste:
    * Click with the middle mouse button
    * Or, use the right-click menu
    * Use shift+insert (some laptops may not have this as a separate key)
* Git-Bash represents Windows-style paths (with backslashes, `\`), like `C:\Users\James`, in the Unix style (with forward slashes, `/`), like `/c/Users/James`
* The `ls` command should work on Git-Bash, but if not, use `dir`


### Detailed-Windows-Setup-Instructions
1. We will be installing the most recent versions of all the software listed. Most likely, the exact version numbers won't be important, but version numbers from May 2025 are listed below for clarity. Most versions of Windows will ask "do you want to allow this program to make changes to your computer" when you're installing software. We will use default options on the install wizards.
2. Download the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installer (version 2.49.0). The download link should automatically choose the right installer for your version of Windows. Navigate to your Downloads folder and run the installer.
3. Git 2.45.1 Setup: Use the default options in the "Select Components" screen and "Select Start Menu Folder". Use the default options in the following several screens. *You may want to check "Additional Icons -> On the Desktop" to easily find this later.*
4. Install R: [R Programming Language](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Click links for "Download R for Windows" and then "install R for the first time" and then the "Download R 4.5.0 for Windows" link to download the file. Navigate to your Downloads folder and run the installer. You will need to allow the installer to make changes to your computer, and you do not need to change any of the default installation options.
5. Install RStudio: [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Choose the download link "Download RStudio For Windows". (This should work on Windows systems from the past several years.)
6. Use the Start Menu or Desktop icon to open Git Bash
7. Download the course data during the walk-through.

### Setting up Bash Shell on Mac
1. A few years ago, MacOS changed the default shell to `zsh` instead of `bash`. The two are similar, but for clarity we will use bash.
2. Open the Terminal app
3. At the prompt, type `bash` and hit enter. Make sure to do this every time you open the terminal. 
4. If you want to change your default shell to bash, so that you don't have to type the bash command every time you use terminal, follow steps 5-8.
5. At the prompt, type `chsh -s /bin/bash` and hit enter. You should see "changing shell for <username>"
6. You will be asked to enter your password, then hit enter. If there are no errors, you will be back at the prompt.
7. Close Terminal and then re-open. You should see in the title bar of the window that it says "Terminal -- -bash"
8. **Note**: This change will persist for your user profile. If you want to change it back after the bootcamp, you will use the command `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
9. Download the course data during the walk-through.

### Setting up R and RStudio on MacOS
1. Click on the Mac icon at the top left of your menu bar and choose "About this Mac". Under "Processor" look for whether it says Intel or Silicon (M1-M3).  Then close the window.
**Macbooks model years <= 2019:** Intel processor
**Macbooks model years 2020-2021**: Either Intel or Silicon M1-M3 processor 
**Macbook model years >= 2025**: ARM M1-M3 processor
2. Go to the Apple menu and select "About this mac" and look under Processor. Note whether you have an Intel process or an M1-M3 (ARM) processor. 
3. Go to [R Programming Language](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and select "Download R for MacOS". Choose the first option `R-4.5.0-arm64.pkg ` if you have a Silicon (M1-M3) processor. Choose the second option `R-4.5.0-x86_64.pkg`if you have an older Intel processor. 
3. Open the pkg file from your Downloads folder and click through the installation wizard with default options. You may need to enter your password.
4. Go to [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Click "Download RStudio for Mac".
5. Open the pkg file. You will see a window open up with an RStudio icon which you will drag into the applications folder.
6. Use the launchpad to open Rstudio. You may see a notification that Rstudio was downloaded from the internet. If so, click "open".
